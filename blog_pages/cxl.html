    <h1>How CXL can impact the current data-center hype.</h1>
    In this blog post I will shortly introduce the promising technology Compute Express Link (CXL) developed in 2019.
    Due to its possibility to reuse older RAM and decreasing costs of datacenters by a large margin Imo a very promising
    technology for the future of data-centers. 

    <br>
    Data-Centers are hot topic right now, Oracle is investing billions of dollars in data-centers (https://www.trendingtopics.eu/billion-dollar-shuffle-openai-nvidia-oracle/), 
    Google is expanding its data-centers (https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2025-11-11-Google-Announces-EUR5-5-Billion-Investment-in-Germany,-including-AI-Infrastructure,-through-2029), 
    also Microsoft is having a huge share in the current hype (https://datacenters.microsoft.com/). A large amount of money is pumped into
    data-centers right now and of course a lot of optimization is happening and has to be done. Having this huge potential and being this hot topic,
    CXL can become a huge impact in how we build data-centers in the future.

    The compute express link is a network technology which lets us access RAM over a PCIe connection. 
    The access performance obviously reduces when connecting over PCIe in contrast to a connection over DIMM.
    However, we now are able to share RAM between processors and can build Memory Pools, which lets us conquer the problem of stranded memory [1]

    Currently I'm in my exam season so I have some other work to do but when I'm finished, I will finish this blog post. In progress...

    Definitions are based on the introduction video from CXL [2]<br>
        <br>
    CXL.io: based on PCIe 5.0 (and PCIe 6.0 after CXL 3.0) with a few enhancements, it provides configuration, link initialization and management, device discovery and enumeration, interrupts, DMA, and register I/O access using non-coherent loads/stores. 
        <br>    <br>
    CXL.cache: defines interactions between a host and a device, allows peripheral devices to coherently access and cache host CPU memory with a low latency request/response interface. 
        <br>    <br>
    CXL.mem: allows host CPU to coherently access device-attached memory with load/store commands for both volatile (RAM) and persistent non-volatile (flash memory) storage
