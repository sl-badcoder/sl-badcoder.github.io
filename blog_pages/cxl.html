    <h1>How CXL can impact the current data-center hype.</h1>
    In this blog post I will shortly introduce the promising technology <b>Compute Express Link (CXL)</b> developed in 2019.
    Due to its possibility to reuse older RAM and decreasing costs of datacenters by a large margin Imo a very promising
    technology for the future of data-centers. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>1. What is CXL and why are data-centers relevant.</h2>
        The compute express link is a network technology which lets us access <b>RAM</b> over a <b>PCIe</b> connection. 
    The access performance obviously reduces when connecting over PCIe in contrast to a connection over DIMM.
    However, we now are able to share RAM between processors and can build Memory Pools, which lets us conquer the problem of stranded memory [1]
      <br>
    <br>
    
    <b>Data-Centers</b> are hot topic right now, Oracle is investing billions of dollars in data-centers [3], 
    Google is expanding its data-centers [4], 
    also Microsoft is having a huge share in the current hype [5]. A large amount of money is pumped into
    data-centers right now and of course a lot of optimizations are happening and have to be done. Having this huge potential and being this hot topic,
    CXL can become a huge impact in how we build data-centers in the future. Powering all this hype if of course like everything right now: comlpicate matrix multiplication.

    <h2>2. Blog progress</h2>
    Currently I'm in my exam season so I have some other work to do but when I'm finished, I will finish this blog post. In progress...

    <h2>3. The technical Part</h3>
    Definitions are based on the introduction video from CXL [2]<br>
        <br>
    CXL.io: based on PCIe 5.0 (and PCIe 6.0 after CXL 3.0) with a few enhancements, it provides configuration, link initialization and management, device discovery and enumeration, interrupts, DMA, and register I/O access using non-coherent loads/stores. 
        <br>    <br>
    CXL.cache: defines interactions between a host and a device, allows peripheral devices to coherently access and cache host CPU memory with a low latency request/response interface. 
        <br>    <br>
    CXL.mem: allows host CPU to coherently access device-attached memory with load/store commands for both volatile (RAM) and persistent non-volatile (flash memory) storage
