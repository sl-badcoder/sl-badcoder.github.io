    In this blog post I will shortly introduce the promising technology Compute Express Link (CXL) developed in 2019. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The compute express link is a network technology which lets us access RAM over PCIe connection. 
    The access performance obviously reduces when connecting over PCIe in contrast to a connection over DIMM.
    However, we now are able to share RAM between processors and can build Memory Pools, which lets us conquer the problem of stranded memory []
    <hr>
    Berger et. al showed that even though the access performance is slower we still can build a memory pool, such that we have comparable performance.
